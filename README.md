What it can do:
- Create a linked list and perform functions as a datatype Set
- Create an Array and perform functions as a datatype Set
- Runs through a driver program testing all the deque functions

How to build yourself:
- DL [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
- CD to deques directory
- run ```go build deques.go```
- remove other executable ```rm deques```
- run ```.\deques.go```
- conversly you can just run ```go run deques.go``` for an instant execution of the program
- I think you may need to set your [$GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) and create a src folder within for go build to work
